<p>The CSV file should start with a line of headings, identifying the
columns following.  The order of the headings doesn't matter, nor does
the case or any whitespace or non-alphanumeric characters (which are
stripped out), but the words should be as listed in bold below.  The
content of the column in question is also as described.

<ul>
<li><b>tetrad</b> (a tetrad)
</ul>

<p>Extra headings are allowed, these will be ignored.</p>
