The Mosses and Liverworts of Cheshire is a project that aims to
document the distribution of all bryophyte species in vice-county
58. Beginning in 2013, the goal is to complete surveying by the end of
2018. The maps illustrated here show progress to-date. For further
information, please contact Des Callaghan
